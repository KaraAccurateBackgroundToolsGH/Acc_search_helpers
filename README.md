# Acc_search_helpers
Python programs to help with public records work at Accurate Background Search

For state-search-helper go into the state-search helper folder and click the .py file. copy it and go to this site
https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/, then paste the contents in and press "run".
In the "shell" section there will be a prompt to input the state, followed by other questions. Be sure to be aware of spelling
when you input the state - or else the program will think you entered a state without restrictions (I may fix it later to reprompt you, 
if a state is misspelled, but for now be aware of spelling). 
- the virgin islands also counts as a valid state - dont worry.
